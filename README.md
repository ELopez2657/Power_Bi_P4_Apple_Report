## Conclusion:

Since 2019, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have shown similar revenue trends. However, City Hotel contributes 51.7% of the total revenue. There isn't a strong correlation between hotel revenue and parking space. Additionally, revenue prediction for early next year indicates a rebound compared to previous months, reaching levels of $949K.
